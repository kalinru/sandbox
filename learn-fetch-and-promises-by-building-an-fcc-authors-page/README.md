# Learn Fetch and Promises by Building an fCC Authors Page, Not started

https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/learn-fetch-and-promises-by-building-an-fcc-authors-page/step-1

One common aspect of web development is learning how to fetch data from an external API, then work with asynchronous JavaScript.

This freeCodeCamp authors page project will show you how to use the fetch method, then dynamically update the DOM to display the fetched data.

This project will also teach you how to paginate your data so you can load results in batches.
